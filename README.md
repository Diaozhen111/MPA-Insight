# Enhancing Named Entity Recognition in Psychological Studies: A Focus on Music Performance Anxiety

## ðŸŽµ Introduction

**Music Performance Anxiety (MPA)** is a significant challenge in psychological studies, impacting musicians' well-being and performance. Traditional methods primarily analyze physiological, cognitive, and behavioral factors separately, limiting their predictive power and practical application. 

To address this, we introduce **Affective-Cognitive Performance Anxiety Network (ACPA-Net)**, a novel computational framework designed to model and predict the multifaceted nature of MPA. ACPA-Net integrates **individual traits, situational variables, and physiological responses** to provide a hierarchical neural architecture that captures both **anticipatory and reactive** dimensions of anxiety.

Additionally, we propose the **Adaptive Cognitive-Affective Feedback Strategy (ACAFS)**, a real-time intervention system that leverages **biofeedback, cognitive restructuring, and behavioral modulation** to mitigate MPA effects and enhance musicians' resilience.

## ðŸš€ Key Features

- **ACPA-Net**: A hierarchical neural network that models MPA through cognitive-affective dynamics.
- **Real-time Adaptation**: Uses **ACAFS** for real-time intervention and anxiety mitigation.
- **Integration of Physiological Data**: Incorporates **heart rate, skin conductance, and muscle tension** for precise anxiety detection.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Enhances accuracy in **anticipatory and reactive anxiety assessment**.
- **Experimental Validation**: Demonstrates effectiveness in **reducing MPA and improving performance quality**.
